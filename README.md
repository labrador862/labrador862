## Hello everyone 

- I am currently a junior at ODU working towards my Bachelor's degree in computer science and likely to pursue a Master's as well.
- My favorite class this semester is linear algebra.
- I'm very interested in learning how to make websites because I would like to make some for my friends looking to make their own businesses.
- Ask me about bodybuilding and One Piece!
